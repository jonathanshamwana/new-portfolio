                    This summer, I was a Growth Engineering Intern @ SiPhox Health. 
                    SiPhox is revolutionizing blood testing, and how we understand our bodies and live longer healthier lives.

                            <li className="p-2"><b>Spend 1-2 hours more on early decisions.</b> The decisions you make at the start of a project have massive implications later on. Poor early decisions can lead to excessive iteration, or the sunk costs fallacy.</li>
                            <li className="p-2"><b>Turn ChatGPT into your second brain.</b> AI won't do everything for you, but it can fill many skill gaps you have, making you less reliant on your busy colleagues.</li>
                            <li className="p-2"><b>Assume you'll embarrass yourself.</b> Especially in a startup, you'll often work outside of the 'scope' of your role. As you pick up new skills and technologies, just assume you'll mess up. Laugh about it.</li>
                            <li className="p-2"><b>Be radically optimistic.</b> Hard work driven by fear is less sustainable than hard work driven by near-delusional confidence in your mission and work.</li>

                            <li className="p-2"><b>Documentation:</b> this goes beyond documenting code, but also documenting my process, and being an internal and external evangelist for my work.</li>
                            <li className="p-2"><b>End-to-end marketing:</b> I integrated email marketing, organic content, paid ads, and other mediums into a full marketing flow, designed to get people in and through the funnel.</li>
                            <li className="p-2"><b>Agile development:</b> although this was inconsistent (because startups can be scrappy), I learned how to plan and execute sprints, ensuring I'm working on the highest priority tasks.</li>

                            <li className="p-2"><b>Started speaking to customers earlier.</b> I learned more about the users I was building for in the final two weeks than the previous 10. All because I spent hours chatting to users on Reddit.</li>
