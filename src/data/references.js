                <p>Jonathan was my summer intern around Event Production Management. In the ten weeks I supervised Jonathan, he brought a <b className="highlight-text">great perspective & work ethic</b> to our team. He had great ideas on how to improve upon our New Student Orientation, which we call Foundation Week. This 10 day event is packed with information & fun, as well as school traditions that every class partakes in. Jonathan had a fresh perspective on how to switch some things up, keep the magic of them, and create more impact.</p>
                <p>To speak to <b className="highlight-text">his work ethic</b>, there wasn't a task left undone, a project put to the side, or anything he didn't jump at the opportunity to do. One of the largest tasks to start the internship was to help reorganize our events supplies storage unit. With his help, it is color coded, stacked by type of supply, and has been way easier to navigate & use this year with my current interns. Life happens, and if ever he had to miss something or he was running late, he was great at giving me a heads up.</p>
                <p>To speak to <b className="highlight-text">his personality</b>, Jonathan has unrivaled charisma & charm. Just his morning greetings and his diction alone light up the spaces he occupies. Pair that with the energy to get things done, the energy of love & peace, and an energy rooted in community & connection, and you have Jonathan. I've no doubt, wherever he goes, whatever field he ends up finding himself in, he will excel and be adored by his colleagues and peers.</p>
                <p>I'll wrap this up by listing off some of <b className="highlight-text">his skills</b>: video editing, organization, communication, coding, community building, production planning, proposal writing, and a less technical skill, lighting up spaces!</p>
                <p>To whomever reads this, again, I've no doubt Jonathan will excel in any position he takes.</p>
                <p>With Love & Peace, -B.E.B</p>

                <p>Jonathan worked with our team as a work-study student for the Student Life Department. In that time, he demonstrated truly exceptional work. Not only did he complete assignments often ahead of time, but also contributed to the <b className="highlight-text">creative decision making</b> of the department and brought in <b className="highlight-text">new and innovative ideas</b> to our work. His contributions to the Experiential Learning in particular is worth noting, as many of the program ideas he presented ended up becoming permanent parts of Minerva's programming. From <b className="highlight-text">professionalism to creativity to intelligence</b> and so much more, I cannot recommend Jonathan highly enough!</p>
